# Paragraphs

I really like using Markdown.

I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.


<br>
<br>
<br>


# Line_Breaks

To create a line break (<br>), end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.

Line 1  
Line 2

You can use two or more spaces (referred to as ‚Äútrailing whitespace‚Äù) for line breaks in nearly every Markdown application, but it‚Äôs controversial. It‚Äôs hard to see trailing whitespace in an editor, and many people accidentally or intentionally put two spaces after every sentence. For this reason, you may want to use something other than trailing whitespace for line breaks. Fortunately, there is another option supported by nearly every Markdown application: the <br> HTML tag.

# Reference-style_Links

### Formatting the First Part of the Link

[hobbit-hole][1]  
[hobbit-hole] [1]

### Formatting the Second Part of the Link

 [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle


In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends
of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to
eat: it was a [hobbit-hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle "Hobbit lifestyles"), and that means comfort.
